Poor Merge and Conflict Resolution,Inquiry_Help,Internal Application,Service Desk,Use third-party merge tools for conflict resolution. Migrate to a system like Git or TFVC with built-in merge tracking.,"Category: Inquiry_Help | Sub-Category: Internal Application
---
Summary:
Provides guidance for resolving issues with poor merge and conflict resolution in internal applications. This article outlines both immediate tooling solutions and strategic recommendations for improving version control systems.

Resolution Steps:
- Step 1: **Assess Current Version Control System:** Identify the specific internal application and version control system (VCS) the user is experiencing merge and conflict resolution difficulties with.
- Step 2: **Recommend Third-Party Merge Tool:** For immediate conflict resolution, advise the user to utilize a suitable third-party merge tool (e.g., KDiff3, Beyond Compare, Meld) to manage complex conflicts. Provide basic instructions or point to existing documentation for integrating and using the tool with their current VCS.
- Step 3: **Document and Escalate Systemic Issues:** If poor merge and conflict resolution is a recurring problem or indicates a fundamental limitation of the current VCS, document the issue thoroughly. Escalate to the appropriate development or infrastructure team with a recommendation to evaluate migration to a modern VCS (e.g., Git, TFVC) that offers robust built-in merge tracking.

Notes:
- The recommendation for migrating to a new VCS (Git, TFVC) is a strategic initiative requiring project planning by development/infrastructure teams. L1/L2's role is to identify the need and escalate.
- Ensure the user has access to or can procure the recommended third-party merge tools.

Lack of Atomic Commits,Inquiry_Help,Internal Application,Service Desk,"Avoid large check-in; break changes into smaller, manageable chunks. Sitch to a modern VCS Like GIT, which guarantees atomic commits","Category: Inquiry_Help | Sub-Category: Internal Application
---
Summary:
This article addresses issues arising from non-atomic code commits, which can lead to incomplete or unstable application states. It outlines best practices for managing code changes and recommends adopting modern version control systems to ensure commit atomicity.

Resolution Steps:
- Step 1: **Break Down Commits:** For any code changes, ensure they are broken down into smaller, logical, and manageable chunks. Each commit should represent a complete, testable unit of work.
- Step 2: **Adopt Modern VCS:** Transition to a modern Version Control System (VCS) such as Git, which inherently guarantees atomic commits. This ensures that all changes within a commit are applied as a single, indivisible transaction, or none are.
- Step 3: **Consult for Migration:** Before initiating a VCS migration, consult with the development lead or architecture team to plan the transition and ensure proper training for development teams on new VCS best practices.

Notes:
- Atomic commits are crucial for maintaining code integrity and preventing corrupted or inconsistent application states during development.
- Adhering to smaller, focused commits improves code reviewability and simplifies potential rollbacks.

Notes:
- `Analyze.exe` is a diagnostic and repair tool specific to Microsoft Visual SourceSafe.
- Regular backups of the SourceSafe database are crucial for recovery from irreparable corruption.
- For recurring corruption issues or to improve system stability, consider escalating for migration to a modern version control system.
